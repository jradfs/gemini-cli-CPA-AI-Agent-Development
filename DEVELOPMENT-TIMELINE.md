## ⚠️ Risk Management

### **High-Risk Items**
1. **MCP Server Stability** - Mitigation: Fallback mechanisms and monitoring
2. **WebSocket Connection Issues** - Mitigation: Reconnection logic and health checks
3. **Performance Under Load** - Mitigation: Load testing and horizontal scaling
4. **Integration Complexity** - Mitigation: Incremental integration and testing

### **Dependencies**
- Google API key availability
- Supabase database access
- MCP server configurations
- Development environment setup

### **Contingency Plans**
- **Fallback to HTTP polling** if WebSocket issues persist
- **Mock MCP servers** for development if remote servers unavailable
- **Gradual rollout** to limit production impact
- **Rollback procedures** for failed deployments
